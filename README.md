## üìù Executive Summary (Business Impact)
Airbnb hosts often struggle to optimize pricing and understand how factors like location, property type, and host reputation affect revenue.  
This dashboard helps users:
- Identify profitable neighborhoods.
- Compare pricing across host types (individuals, professionals, big companies).
- Analyze the influence of superhost status.
- Examine customer review patterns.
- Estimate listing prices using a basic ML model.

**Outcome:** Helps maximize rental income and understand market trends visually.
